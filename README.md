Features:

* Play local video files with many formats supported, 
  if `ffmpeg` can transcode it - you can play it (mkv, mp4, avi, mov, wmv, webm, ...)
* Preliminary transcoding of whole file not required - it will only transcode parts when it's necessary
* Adaptive video bitrate
* Switch between multiple audio tracks (when part of video container)
* Enable subtitles (when part of video container)
* Save a fragment of video as gif (as project name suggests)

Limitations:

* Minor video or audio artifacts may occur
* For local use only (no security implemented)
* Transcoding depends on performance of the machine (some formats work better, some not)
